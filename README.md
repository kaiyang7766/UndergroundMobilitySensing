Location information about commuter activities is vital for planning for travel disruptions and infrastructural development. However, GPS connectivity is lost when underground in our MRT networks. 

The Mobility Sensing Project aims to find innovative and novel ways to conduct location sensing using multi-sensory data collected in smartphones.
